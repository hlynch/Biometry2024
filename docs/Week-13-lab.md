Week 13 Lab
=============



In lab we'll go through 

1. Model selection / model comparison

2. Model criticism

**We will need a series of packages for today's lab, some of which we have not used before: MASS, lmtest, MuMIn, car, and gvlma.**

Part 1: Model selection / model comparison
------------------------

There is a frog dataset on the distribution of the Southern Corroboree frog that we are going to attach. More information on the definition of the covariates in this dataset can be found [here](https://www.key2stats.com/data-set/view/235).


```r
frogs<-read.csv("_data/frogs.csv",header=T)
head(frogs)
```

```

```

Make sure you understand how the pch command is working in the above plot command.


```r
pairs(cbind(altitude,distance,NoOfPools,NoOfSites,avrain,meanmin,meanmax))
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" />

Looking at the data in this way, are there any covariates that might benefit from transformation?

**Question: Why bother transforming a covariate?**

<details>
  <summary>Click for Answer</summary>
<span style="color: blueviolet;">
As you can see from the scatterplots, some covariates have points with large leverage, and these point may (but don't always) have high influence on model fit. Often we want all the points to have roughly equal influence on the model fit so we will apply a transformation like the log() to spread out small values all bunched together and to pull in large values that are much larger than the others. These transformations (e.hg., log, square root) are often referred to as "variance stabilizing" transformations.
</span>
</details> 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Let's try log-transforming "distance" and "Number of Pools".


```r
pairs(cbind(altitude,log(distance),log(NoOfPools),NoOfSites,avrain,meanmin,meanmax))
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />

Let's fit a GLM with all the variables.

**<span style="color: green;">Checkpoint #1: Why a GLM?</span>** <span style="color: white;">Because the response variable is binary 0/1.</span>


```r
frogs.glm0<-glm(pres.abs~altitude+log(distance)+log(NoOfPools)+NoOfSites+avrain+meanmin+meanmax,family=binomial,data=frogs,na.action=na.fail)
summary(frogs.glm0)
```

```

## 
## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5
```

(The na.action flag is so MuMIn won't complain further down.)

Anything look funny? Well, for one, meanmin is highly significant but meanmax and altitude are not - but we would expect these three variables to be highly correlated.

Use the vif() function to explore this further


```r
vif(frogs.glm0)
```

```
##       altitude  log(distance) log(NoOfPools)      NoOfSites         avrain 
##     850.879518       1.396014       1.306058       1.401175      16.664582 
##        meanmin        meanmax 
##      29.319704     996.949239
```

It appears that the variances for altitude and meanmax are inflated. **<span style="color: green;">Checkpoint #2: Why?</span>**

Plot the data:


```r
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(altitude,meanmax)
plot(altitude,meanmin)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />

```r
cor(altitude,meanmax)
```

```
## [1] -0.996557
```

```r
cor(altitude,meanmin)
```

```
## [1] -0.953661
```

Question: So...what do we do?

Answer: Let's try removing the least biologically significant variable first. I suggest we remove altitude.


```r
frogs.glm1<-glm(pres.abs~log(distance)+log(NoOfPools)+NoOfSites+avrain+meanmin+meanmax,family=binomial,data=frogs)
summary(frogs.glm1)
```

```
##

##     avrain + meanmin + meanmax, family = binomial, data = frogs)

## meanmax        -2.3624614  1.0678821  -2.212 0.026947 *

## AIC: 211.65
## 
## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5
```

Better, but we still have a lot of multicollinearity between meanmin and meanmax.

We could choose one or the other but at this point, let's leave them both in and try and find the best model we can.

First, let's do a little review of the three comparison criteria we discussed on Tuesday:

1. Likelihood (specifically, likelihood ratio)

2. Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC)

3. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

We get the log-likelihood of a model in R using the logLik command


```r
logLik(frogs.glm0)
```

```
## 'log Lik.' -98.81244 (df=8)
```

```r
logLik(frogs.glm1)
```

```
## 'log Lik.' -98.82714 (df=7)
```

How do we do the likelihood ratio test?

Remember that

$$
-2*(LL(smaller)-LL(bigger))
\sim \chi^{2}_{\mbox{difference in parameters}}
$$

In R we can do this with


```r
test.stat<--2*(logLik(frogs.glm1)-logLik(frogs.glm0))
as.numeric(test.stat) # as.numeric is just to suppress the labels which can be misleading
```

```
## [1] 0.02941079
```

```r
as.numeric(1-pchisq(test.stat,df=1))
```

```
## [1] 0.863834
```

**<span style="color: green;">Checkpoint #3: How do we interpret that p-value?</span>**

<span style="color: white;">Answer: This p-value is the probability that the larger model fits the data better only by the amount expected by its additional degree of freedom. In this case, we can not reject the null hypothesis that the two models are equivalent, and so we would prefer the smaller model on the basis of parsimony.</span>

We can actually get R to do the LRT automatically using the 'lrtest' function in the 'lmtest' package.


```r
library('lmtest')
lrtest(frogs.glm0,frogs.glm1)
```

```
## Likelihood ratio test
## 
## Model 1: pres.abs ~ altitude + log(distance) + log(NoOfPools) + NoOfSites + 
##     avrain + meanmin + meanmax
## Model 2: pres.abs ~ log(distance) + log(NoOfPools) + NoOfSites + avrain + 
##     meanmin + meanmax
##   #Df  LogLik Df  Chisq Pr(>Chisq)
## 1   8 -98.812                     
## 2   7 -98.827 -1 0.0294     0.8638
```

This gives us exactly the same result we got before.

We could also have also compared these models by looking at the ANOVA table for comparison


```r
anova(frogs.glm0,frogs.glm1)
```

```
## Analysis of Deviance Table
## 
## Model 1: pres.abs ~ altitude + log(distance) + log(NoOfPools) + NoOfSites + 
##     avrain + meanmin + meanmax
## Model 2: pres.abs ~ log(distance) + log(NoOfPools) + NoOfSites + avrain + 
##     meanmin + meanmax
##   Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df  Deviance
## 1       204     197.62             
## 2       205     197.65 -1 -0.029411
```

How do we calculate AIC for these two models?


```r
logLik(frogs.glm0)
```

```
## 'log Lik.' -98.81244 (df=8)
```

```r
k<-8
AIC.glm0<-as.numeric(-2*logLik(frogs.glm0)+2*k)
AIC.glm0
```

```
## [1] 213.6249
```

```r
AIC(frogs.glm0)
```

```
## [1] 213.6249
```

```r
AIC(frogs.glm1)
```

```
## [1] 211.6543
```

Question: Are these significantly different? 

Answer: This is a trick question. In an Information Theoretic context, we avoid the term "significant" because it is implied that we mean "statistically significant" in the context of hypothesis testing, and no hypothesis test is being performed. AIC simply gives us information on the weight of evidence for one model over another. There are no theoretically justified guidelines (although Burnham and Anderson suggest some as we discussed in lecture). It is better (in my opinion) to convert AICs into model weights and, if it makes sense in the context, to do model averaging.

How about BIC? USe the AIC function with a different flag for the penalty.


```r
AIC(frogs.glm0,k=log(nrow(frogs)))
```

```
## [1] 240.4776
```

```r
AIC(frogs.glm1,k=log(nrow(frogs)))
```

```
## [1] 235.1504
```

We could also do this with the BIC() function


```r
BIC(frogs.glm0)
```

```
## [1] 240.4776
```

```r
BIC(frogs.glm1)
```

```
## [1] 235.1504
```

As a group, find a small set (3-5) of candidate models, calculate the AIC for each of these models, and calculate model weights.

**<span style="color: green;">Checkpoint #4: What covariates were in the best performing model (among the ones you tried as a group) and what was its model weight?</span>**

Model selection via step-wise regression
--------------------

Ideally, we can narrow down the set of candidate covariates based on biology alone. Another approach that is common in the literature, but which has been criticized, is stepwise regression. The default of the step() function is to use both forward and backward steps. If the function step is given the full model, it will begin with the full model, no matter which direction it is working.


```r
step(frogs.glm0) #same as step(frogs.glm0,direction="both")
```

The output can be interpreted as follows: the full model has an AIC of 213.62, but if NoOfSites were removed the subsequent model would have an AIC of 211.62, if avrain were removed 211.64, etc, including $<none>$, which represents removing no variables. The covariates are listed in order of lowest AIC if they were to be removed, to highest AIC. Since removing NoOfSites would result in the lowest AIC, including being lower than the current model, $<none>$, NoOfSites is removed for the next step and the process is repeated over again. This continues until $<none>$ has the lowest AIC, meaning no variables can be removed to decrease the AIC from the current model. In this case, this occurred when log(NoOfPools), log(distance), meanmax, and meanmin were in the model. At this point, the process ends and the model from that step is reported as the output.

**However, if we attempt to use forward stepwise selection starting with the full model, the process does not work.** The function begins with the full model, sees that there are no variables it could add to decrease the AIC because we haven't given it any more variables, then reports the full model as the outcome.


```r
step(frogs.glm0,direction="forward")
```

```
## Start:  AIC=213.62
## pres.abs ~ altitude + log(distance) + log(NoOfPools) + NoOfSites + 
##     avrain + meanmin + meanmax
```

##

##     NoOfSites + avrain + meanmin + meanmax, family = binomial,

This is clearly not the result that we want, because there are many insignificant variables in the model.

**We need to give the function the model that we want it to start with, in this case, the "empty model."** The empty model predicts the number of species at a site using no covariates, only an intercept, and is denoted as pres.abs ~ 1 in R.

We also need to give the step function all of the possible covariates that it can add to find the best model. This is done using the scope= ~ command in step. 


```r
step(frogs.glm.empty, scope= ~log(distance)+log(NoOfPools)+NoOfSites+avrain+meanmin+meanmax, data=frogs, direction="forward")

The function now does what we want it to do! It begins with the empty model and reports an AIC of 281.99, and lists the AIC for each variable if it were to be added to the empty model (log(distance) = 229.15, meanmin = 258.40, etc.). Since adding log(distance) results in the lowest AIC, it adds log(distance), then repeats the process. It continues this process until $<none>$ is at the top of the list, meaning there are no variables that can be added that will decrease the AIC. It then reports that model, in this case pres.abs ~ log(distance) + log(NoOfPools) + meanmin + meanmax, as the best model.

Starting with the full model works fine for direction = "both". It takes the full model, takes away the least useful covariate, then has the option to add that covariate back in, or take away another. It repeats this until neither adding nor subtracting variables decreases the AIC of the model.

What does the output mean "with shrinkage"? These estimates include a zero value when a parameter does not actually appear in a model. In this case 'altitude' appears in only one of the two models and so the estimate "with shrinkage" is signicantly smaller than the parameter value estimated only from a weighting of the models including the covariate 'altitude'.

Part 2: Model criticism
------------------------

We are going to use a dataset that comes from the journal Ecology, which is available [here](https://github.com/hlynch/Biometry2021/tree/master/_data/Ernest2003.pdf).

STOP: Let's read the abstract so we know what we are modelling.

The goal is to create the best possible, most parsimonious model for maximum longevity in non-volant mammals. The covariates we have in this dataset to consider are:

Order           
Family                   
Genus               
Species              
Mass (g)              
Gestation (mo)            
Newborn weight (g)            
Weaning age (mo)             
Weaning mass (g)             
Age of first reproduction (mo)            
Litter size                
Litters/year                  

First, we will load the data and the 'car' package, and use 'names' to see what the columns are named


```r
data<-read.csv("_data/MammalLifeHistory.csv")
attach(data)
names(data)
```

```
##  [1] "Order"          "Family"         "Genus"          "Species"       
##  [5] "Mass"           "Gestation"      "Newborn"        "Weaning"       
##  [9] "WeanMass"       "AFR"            "MaxLifespan"    "LitterSize"    
## [13] "LittersPerYear"
```

Before fitting any models, let's just look at each potential covariate vs. maximum longevity to get a sense for which variables need to be transformed. I list get the first few here...


```r
boxplot(MaxLifespan~Order)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="672" />

```r
boxplot(MaxLifespan~Family)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-2.png" width="672" />

```r
boxplot(MaxLifespan~Genus)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-3.png" width="672" />

```r
boxplot(MaxLifespan~Species)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-4.png" width="672" />

```r
plot(MaxLifespan~Mass)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-5.png" width="672" />

```r
plot(MaxLifespan~Gestation)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-6.png" width="672" />

Note that most of the covariates need to be transformed to linearize the relationship. The easiest transformation to try is the log() - the covariates that should probably be transformed relate to mass and time periods: Mass, Gestation, Newborn, Weaning, WeanMass, AFR, LittersPerYear (possible, not clear what the best transmation is for this). In other words, look at:


```r
plot(MaxLifespan~log10(Mass))
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" width="672" />

```r
plot(MaxLifespan~log10(Gestation))
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-2.png" width="672" />

etc.

For now, let's ignore the taxonomic covariates and focus on just three covariates: Mass, AFR, and LitterSize.

*Fitting the model using 'lm'*

Let's fit the model with Mass,AFR, and LitterSize. We will consider this the full model.


```r
fit<-lm(MaxLifespan~log10(Mass)+log10(AFR)+LitterSize)
summary(fit)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = MaxLifespan ~ log10(Mass) + log10(AFR) + LitterSize)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

## F-statistic: 273.1 on 3 and 485 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

*Model diagnostics*

Let's look at the residuals as a function of the fitted values:


```r
plot(fitted(fit),residuals(fit))
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" width="672" />

Let's look at the residuals using the 'car' package function 'residualPlots'. This command produces scatterplots of the residuals versus each of the predictors and versus the final fitted value. Note that what we did manually above is reproduced as the final panel here.


```r
residualPlots(fit)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="672" />

```
##             Test stat Pr(>|Test stat|)    
## log10(Mass)   12.8413           <2e-16 ***
## log10(AFR)    11.6289           <2e-16 ***
## LitterSize     0.2717            0.786    
## Tukey test    15.0728           <2e-16 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

We can assess the normality of the residuals by histogramming the studentized residuals. We can pull these out from the fitted model using the 'studres' function from the 'MASS' package.


```r
sresid<-studres(fit)
hist(sresid,freq=FALSE)
xfit<-seq(min(sresid),max(sresid),length=40)
yfit<-dnorm(xfit)
lines(xfit,yfit)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="672" />

A variation on the basic residual plot is the marginal model plot.


```r
marginalModelPlots(fit)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="672" />

Note that loess smoothers have been added showing the non-parametric regression between the actual data (solid line) and the model prediction (dashed line) against each of the predictor variables. If these two lines are close together, that is an indication of good model fit.

Note that the marginal plots display the relationship between the response and each covariates IGNORING the other covariates. We can also look at the relationship between the response and each covariates CONTROLLING for the other covariates. We do this through "added variable plots".

Let's say we have the following model

$$
Y \sim X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3}
$$

There are two steps in building the added-variable plot for $X_{1}$:

1. Regress

$$
Y \sim X_{2} + X_{3}
$$

The residuals from this plot reflect all the variation that is not otherwise explained in the model (i.e. by all the covariates except $X_{1}$).

2. Regress

$$
X_{1} \sim X_{2} + X_{3}
$$

The residuals from this plot represent the part of $X_{1}$ not explained by the other covariates.

The added variable plot is simply a plot of the residuals from #1 on the y-axis and the residuals from #2 on the x-axis.

We can do this in R using the function 'avPlots' from the 'car' package


```r
avPlots(fit,id.n=2)
```

```
## Warning in plot.window(...): "id.n" is not a graphical parameter
```

```
## Warning in plot.xy(xy, type, ...): "id.n" is not a graphical parameter
```

```
## Warning in axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...): "id.n" is not a

```

```
## Warning in box(...): "id.n" is not a graphical parameter
```

```
## Warning in title(...): "id.n" is not a graphical parameter

## graphical parameter
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="672" />

The id.n option will cause the plot to identify the two points that are furthest from the mean on the x axis and the two with the largest absolute residuals.

The added variable plot allows us to visualize the effect of each covariate after adjusting for all the other covariates in the model.

We can also look at leverage by using the command 'leveragePlots'


```r
leveragePlots(fit)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672" />

For covariates with only a single degree of freedom (i.e. not different levels of a factor), this will simply be a rescaled version of the added-variable plots.

*Outliers*

Let's look for outliers using the 'car' function 'outlierTest' which reports the Bonferroni p-values for Studentized residuals:


```r
outlierTest(fit)
```

```
##      rstudent unadjusted p-value Bonferroni p
## 1440 6.797206         3.1481e-11   1.5394e-08
## 1439 6.284883         7.3267e-10   3.5828e-07
## 1438 4.650225         4.2834e-06   2.0946e-03
## 1437 4.488601         8.9697e-06   4.3862e-03
```

Plot the qqplot for the studentized residuals using the 'car' package function qqPlot. WARNING: This is not the same as qqplot (lower case p); this is a specialized function in the 'car' package that will plot the appropriate qqplot for the studentized residuals given a fitted model as input.


```r
qqPlot(fit)
```

<img src="Week-13-lab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="672" />

```
## [1] 1439 1440
```

To identify points with high leverage, we want to calculate the hat values for each of the points. We can do this using the 'hatvalues" command in the 'car' package.


```r
hatvalues(fit)
```

```

Note that the 'stats' package has a function called 'lm.influence' that provides much the same information.

We can make a plot that highlights highly influential values. We will use John Fox's suggested cut-off of 4/(n-p-1) where n=number of data points and p=number of estimated parameters.


```r
cutoff<-4/((nrow(data)-length(fit$coefficients)-2))
plot(fit,which=4,cook.levels=cutoff)
```

Another useful plot is created by 'influencePlot' which creates a "bubble" plot of studentized residuals by hat values, with the areas of the circles representing the observations proportional to Cook's distances. Vertical reference lines are drawn at twice and three times the average hat value, horizontal reference lines at -2,0,2 on the studentized-residual scale.


```r
influencePlot(fit,id.method="identify")
```

```

*Heteroskedacity*

Although we can often pick up heteroskedacity graphically, we can test for it formally by using the 'ncvTest' function in the 'car' package


```r
ncvTest(fit)
```

```
## Non-constant Variance Score Test 
## Variance formula: ~ fitted.values 
## Chisquare = 297.9263, Df = 1, p = < 2.22e-16
```

We can also use the function 'spreadLevelPlot' from the 'car' package to create plots for examining potential heteroskedacity in the data.


```r
spreadLevelPlot(fit)
```

```
## Warning in spreadLevelPlot.lm(fit): 
## 47 negative fitted values removed
```

```
## 
## Suggested power transformation:  0.4508167
```

*Multicollinearity*

We can calculate the variance inflation factors using the function 'vif'


```r
vif(fit)
```

```
## log10(Mass)  log10(AFR)  LitterSize 
##    2.466580    2.434861    1.759614
```

*Serially correlated residuals*

Remember, linear modelling assumes that the residuals independent and identically distributed. You can test whether the residuals are serially autocorrelated using the Durban-Watson statistic

$$
d=\frac{\sum^{T}_{t=2}(e_{t}-e_{t-1})^{2}}{\sum^{T}_{t=1}e^{2}_{t}}
$$

where T is the number of data points.

We can calculate the Durban-Watson test as follows:


```r
durbinWatsonTest(fit)
```

```
##  lag Autocorrelation D-W Statistic p-value
##    1       0.6286888     0.6560464       0
##  Alternative hypothesis: rho != 0
```

*More help with model diagnostics*

There is another package that can help with model diagnostics called the 'gvlma' or "Global Validation of Linear Model Assumptions".

Install 'gvlma'


```r
library(gvlma)
gvmodel<-gvlma(fit)
summary(gvmodel)
```

```
